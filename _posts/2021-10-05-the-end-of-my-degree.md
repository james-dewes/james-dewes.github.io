For the last __six__ years I have been working through a degree with the Open University and after many, many hours spent sat in front of
my computer working late nights to meet a deadline I have at last submitted my final assessed piece towards a BSc in Computing  and IT.

I submitted back on the 20th of September, but it has taken me until now to get over that and start to process what comes next.

For quite a long time I was close to a first and there is still a slim chance I will get one, however, it all comes down to the last mark on my last assignment, so I am resigned to passing with a respectable 2:1. Since I started my degree I have gotten married, had a daughter, moved house, had another daughter, changed job role 4 times, worked through a pandemic and started with a new company for the first time in 13 years, so I think I can cut myself a little slack.

Results day is the 30th of November 2021 and with a bit of luck I might get a graduation ceremony in 2022, but we will see what happens with the understandable backlog.

So, now I find myself asking, what will I do with all this time? Well, where I am working now at Modo25 puts a lot of emphasis on personal responsibility and personal development. We only work 4 days a week, but those 4 days are expected to be effective and impactful. To that end I have been reading books such as Colt McAnlis' _Plan, Act, Impact_ and Brian Tracy's _Eat That Frog_ among others. I haven't previously been a big fan of self-improvement books, instead working like Boxer in Animal Farm, convincing myself that longer hours were the only way to be productive no matter the personal cost, but I am beginning to see some of the positives both with a better work-life balance and still getting things done. 

With that in mind, you can expect to see more updates, both here and on Modo25's blog, like my recent report on 
 [Designing for data projects at Leeds Digital Festival](https://modo25.com/events/designing-for-data-projects-at-leeds-digital-festival/). I also have clear goals for the year and have been making steady progress towards them, with more of them due to be completed very soon so watch this space.
