Tomorrow, for the first time in a long time, I am going to be the new guy as I start at the fantastic [Modo25](https://modo25.com) in Leeds!
 
I am looking forward to getting stuck in as a Data Engineer, working with great tech and great people in a company that likes to go fast and uses technology as a leaver to help shift the dial of what is possible in marketing.
 
Thank you to everyone who has supported me and to the Modo25 team for giving me this opportunity!
