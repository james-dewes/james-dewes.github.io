Not a typical Developer I have moved from marketing to data analysis, development then data engineering, bringing with me a love of technology and experience across a range of disciplines. With commercial experience in several programming languages and an international Hackathon award to my name I also have a BSc in Computing and IT with the Open University which I completed in my spare time.

Since 2008 I have been working in the Digital Marketing sector and have had the pleasure of working with some of the largest brands in UK over that time, including Argos, BHS, Comet, Experian, Habitat, Homebase, Made.com, Maplin, Royal British Legion, Selfridges, Play.com, The Range, TopMan, TopShop and Yours.

More than 7 years of that time was spent delivering complex reporting and analytics solutions with a range of technologies, delivering training to internal teams and maintaining software to support the automation of paid search and shopping channels. I progressed to a team lead role and won a major company award for project work in that role.

I also had the pleasure of being an ambassador for the business in the local digital community and was at the launch of [C4DI]( http://www.c4di.co.uk/).

Following changes in the business I had the opportunity to follow my passion for building things, first as a specialist in product feeds, building tooling to aid in on-boarding clients and then as a Junior Developer on Wordpress and Shopify, focusing on front-end deliverables, but working across the stack as needed.

In 2021 I joined Modo25 combining my data and development experiance into a data engineering role where my main objective is to deskill data use through automation, making processes and systems as fast and intuative as possible. 

Outside of work I like to tinker with different technologies and have entered a number of local and national hackathons. I love the atmosphere of a hackathon, working to build innovative solutions to tight deadlines, learning on the job and collaborating with others.
