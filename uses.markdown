Inspired by [Wes Bos](wesbos.com) from the Syntax podcast I am trying to keep a list of some of the software and hardware I use.

<h2 class="u-h2">Editor and Terminal</h2>
+ VS Code
+ Slime is my current theme, reccomended by Jeffery Way of [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/).
+ Chrome which I switched to from Firefox for the developer tools somewhere around 2013.

<h2 class="u-h2">Desk Setup</h2>
+ Corsair K70 (Cherry MX Brown) which is in the mid-range for noise, but feels very nice to use day to day. I love the media keys and volume control as I like to listen to music when I am working. When most of your job is typing, I can't recomend it enough, although everyone on a call knows when you are typing up your notes.
  
+ Cyberpower Gaming Battalion 504 because PC towers don't die, they just get upgraded.
  
+ Element Gaming Mouse Cobalt 220 which has 5 buttons and a nice feel to it.
  
+ TeckNet GH10928 Surround Sound Gaming Headset which make me look like an air traffic controller, but that let me hear them and they me perfectly. Love the on-ear volume controls for when I can't use my Corsair K70.
