Inspired by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com) from the Syntax podcast I am trying to keep a list of some of the software and hardware I use.

<h2 class="u-h2">Editor and Terminal</h2>
+ VS Code
+ Slime is my current theme, reccomended by Jeffery Way of [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/).
+ Chrome which I switched to from Firefox for the developer tools somewhere around 2013.

<h2 class="u-h2">Desk Setup</h2>
+ Corsair K70 (Cherry MX Brown) which is in the mid-range for noise, but feels very nice to use day to day. I love the media keys and volume control as I like to listen to music when I am working. When most of your job is typing, I can't recomend it enough, although everyone on a call knows when you are typing up your notes.
  
+ Cyberpower Gaming Battalion 504 because PC towers don't die, they just get upgraded.

+ Dell Latitude 7280 a capable working laptop with an Intel i7 processor and 16GB RAM.
  
+ Corsair Glaive a 5 buttons mouse with an interchangeable thumb rest for a more flexable fit.
  
+ Corsair VOID RGB ELITE Wireless Premium Gaming Headset with 7.1 Surround Sound â€” Carbon

<h2 class="u-h2">On the move</h2>

+ RK68 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard, 60% keyboard with Red switches - a little tall, but decent for on the go.

+ Google Pixel Buds Pro Charcoal - great switching between my phone and laptop although the mic is a little unreliable.
