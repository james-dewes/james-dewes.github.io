Yesterday I walked the 12 miles or so from Hull to the Humber Bridge in Hessle. The rout was flat, mostly paved and well maintained, with opportunities to stop at St Andrews Quay and at the Foreshore itself.

The walk is very close to the A63, so there is a lot of traffic noise and smell, but there is a fantastic view across the river towards Barton Upon Humber, which seemed to have all the sunshine I missed.

The three highlights for me where the bridge itself, which is always impressive, The Deep which was our start point and walking through the working port on the route, which I found very interesting.
