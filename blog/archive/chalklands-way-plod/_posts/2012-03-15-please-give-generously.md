We are raising money for Action Medical Research, a great children's charity dedicated to improving the health of babies and children in the UK.

The team will be undertaking a gruelling 40 mile hike across the Yorkshire Wolds, following the Chalklands Way.

This doesn't just mean tuning up on the day, it is almost 2 marathons back to back, so there will be many hours of training and preparation as well as fundraising, from everyone involved.

We will be blogging about our experience and about the walk and our training.

Please help us in our challenge and make the lives of parents and children across the UK better by [donating a small sum](https://www.action.org.uk/node/269835/donate).

Please tick the Gift Aid box if you are a UK tax payer as the UK Government will contribute an additional 25% on the money that we have raised.
