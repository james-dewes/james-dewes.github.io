I walked from Millington Wood to Huggate and then back again via a more indirect route down the Minster Way bridle path, with Rob, our girlfriends and a friend. There was a serious hill, almost a scramble and a few ups and downs. It was quite close to the Chalkland Way's path through the area.

There are some lovely areas on this walk and the Millington Pastures are impressive tracts of open access land. Part way along the Route there is a waymarker for the Wolds Way, 35 miles to Hessle and 45 to Filey. Below is a photos taken there, with Rob (right), his partner Amanda (on the left) and their friend Amanda (centre).
