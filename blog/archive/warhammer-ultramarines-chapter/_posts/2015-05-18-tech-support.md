With all the shiny new mechanicum miniatures release lately I have been inspired to put paint to plastic with my own martian contingent.

![Four pale skinned servitors in overalls](../../assets/images/warhammer/servitors.png)

The four servo arm servitors are the ones I am most likely to take in any given game and with half a chance they will be up to their sockets in immobilised Rhinos so I have tried for a greasy look on their much worn overalls and a flesh tone similar to my necrotic Cyber Cherub from earlier posts.
