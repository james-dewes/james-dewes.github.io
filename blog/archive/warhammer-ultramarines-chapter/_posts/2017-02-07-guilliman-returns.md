Games Workshop have gotten ahead of the rumour-mill and announce that for the first time in 10 millennia a true son of the Emperor will walk the stars. Guilliman returns!

Gathering Storm III is going to be the latest release in a major advancement of the 40k universe narrative. It is big news for the Ultramarines, but I am left looking at the horizon with a little trepidation. Guilliman being the first to return to the loyalists leaves him open to a fast power creep and the end time narrative also heralded the literal end of the Warhammer franchise.

Leaping over this trepidation though, it is monumental news and exciting enough to get me back to building, painting, playing and (when I remember) blogging.
