I have mentioned in a few posts already my local Gaming club Hulls Angels. It is a fantastic place full of friendly and like minded people and is doubly worth a visit now as they have just relocated!

Their new gaming hall is larger and better equipped, 20 tables, varied terrain and some storage space for club members too. There is more soft seating, space for board games, displays including award winning miniatures.

These are the guys who keep me coming back to the hobby time after time, with loads of enthusiasm, loads of ideas and always something going on. If you are in Hull go pay them a visit. Find out more about them on their site: hullsangels.com
