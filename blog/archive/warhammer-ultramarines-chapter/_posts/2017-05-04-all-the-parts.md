Today I realised I have hit a landmark. I finally have all of the parts I need to complete all 10 companies and a significant amount of support material.

There are still a few holes in the collection and I am a little light in terms of tanks and flyers, but after so many years of working towards it is finally some light at the end of the proverbial tunnel.

Now I just need to get everything painted, based and into a game!
