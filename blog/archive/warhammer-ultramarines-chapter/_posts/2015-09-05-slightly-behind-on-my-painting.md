So, how can you tell you are slightly behind on your painting? When you have to use an entire can of Chaos black undercoat and you still have not finished! For the record today I undercoated:

* 3 Drop-pods
* 7 Rhinos & Razorbacks
* 1 Predator
* 1 Bastion
  
Assorted turrets, guns, emplacements and tank parts
It does not sound like a lot, but it is a lot of square footage of plastic to cover. Right, now to make it blue...
