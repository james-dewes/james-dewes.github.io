I used to go to Games Day pretty regularly, but I am yet to go to Warhammer fest. It is a shame, but the 2 day format and the focus moving away from gaming towards collecting and painting has made it far less appealing.

Yes I like seeing the outstanding miniatures entered into the Golden Daemon and seeing some of the work from the design team, but the massive boards and games built and run by the stores has always been the main draw for me. Seeing what is possible when a few people think big and try and do something fun is always inspiring and having the chance to join in and throw a few dice adds to the fun. 

I hope it works out for Games Workshop, but I don't think the new format is for me and I hope that we see different types of event in the future.
