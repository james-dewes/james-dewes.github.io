A T Stop on ice skates sounded simple and looked simple in this great [demo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8CWdQyYxzc) by Expert Village, but was not as simple as I thought.

Keeping at it, I found that putting pressure on the outside edge, with my trailing foot at the 45° angle as the video recommended was really tricky. I kept putting too much weight on my back foot as I lent backwards. The shape of my leading skate blade and my balance meant that once I took the weight off the ball of my foot I felt like I was going to fall backwards so I put weight on my back foot and fell down.

I managed a scruffy T stop by using the inside edge and dragging my foot behind me. This gave me a better sense of balance. I am still twisting as I do this on my off foot, so I will keep at it and add any more insight I have as I go along.
