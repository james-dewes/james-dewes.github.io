Back in the year 2000 I went ice skating twice. I didn't enjoy it very much and ended up with scars on my ankles from where the hire-skates rubbed me. However in 2011 I had moved to Hull and near the fantastic Hull Ice Arena, so looking for something new to try I thought I would give it another go. After a tentative start  I thought it was absolutely brilliant and have been going once a week since then. I wanted to blog about my experience learning the very basics as ice skating is, like many other sports, a bit of a closed book to me and writing things down will help me think about what I am doing.
