Getting moving looks easy, oddly enough I found that it is and it isn't. If you can stand in one spot and turn your toes out to make a V shape you will start going forward. Great, assuming your legs are about 50ft long. I very quickly found myself heading for the splits with that one. If you pull your legs back together it is called a forward swizzle, scissors, fishes, or, as I like to call it, sculling. You need strong thighs for this one as they do all the work in the inwards and outwards motion.
