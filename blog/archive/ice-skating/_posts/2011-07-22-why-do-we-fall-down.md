Credit to the title goes to Batman!

My first few sessions on the ice were spent wobbling along clinging to the side. When I let go I did fall over, everyone falls over, you just need to laugh at yourself and try again. I mostly fall over backwards when ice skating, this is because I didn't have my balance right to start with. The wonderful people at the rink pointed out that I needed to bend my knees and lean forward a little. It made a huge difference to how I balanced, so did keeping my head up. I wanted to look at my feet to see what is going on, but that kept throwing my weight too far forward. It also meant I couldn't see what I was about to crash into.

I still fall over, or flap like a chicken trying not to, but even the pros fall sometimes, after all, we are standing on ice.
